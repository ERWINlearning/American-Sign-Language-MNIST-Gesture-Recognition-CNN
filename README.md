# American Sign Language MNIST & Gesture Recognition CNN

## Overview

Welcome to the American Sign Language MNIST & Gesture Recognition CNN project! This initiative is a deep dive into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for precise American Sign Language (ASL) MNIST classification and sophisticated gesture recognition. Harness the power of computer vision with our detailed Jupyter Notebook (`American_Sign_Language_MNIST_&_Gesture_Recongition_CNN.ipynb`), replete with code, comprehensive documentation, diagrams, and even mathematical formulas, empowering you to explore, train, and apply the model.

## Motivation

Understanding and interpreting sign language is crucial for fostering inclusivity. Traditional methods often face challenges in recognizing complex hand gestures. This project addresses these challenges by implementing a robust CNN that excels in ASL MNIST classification and gesture recognition.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python (>=3.6)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **TensorFlow**
- **OpenCV**

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salarMokhtariL/American-Sign-Language-MNIST-Gesture-Recognition-CNN.git
    ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook:**

    ```bash
    cd American-Sign-Language-MNIST-Gesture-Recognition-CNN
    jupyter notebook American_Sign_Language_MNIST_&_Gesture_Recongition_CNN.ipynb
    ```

3. **Follow the Instructions:**

    Execute each code cell and unravel the potential of ASL MNIST classification and gesture recognition.

## Deep Dive into the Notebook

1. **Introduction:**
   - Explore the project's goals and understand the significance of accurate ASL MNIST classification and gesture recognition.

2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - Dive into loading the ASL MNIST dataset, exploring image preprocessing techniques, and preparing the dataset for robust model training.

3. **Model Architecture:**
   - Uncover the inner workings of the CNN architecture, featuring convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers, crafted for ASL MNIST classification and gesture recognition.

   ![CNN Architecture](path/to/cnn_diagram.png)

   The architecture can be defined mathematically as:

   \[ H_l = \sigma(W_l * X_{l-1} + b_l) \]
   \[ X_l = \text{Pooling}(H_l) \]

   Where:
   - \( H_l \) is the hidden layer at depth \( l \).
   - \( W_l \) is the weight matrix.
   - \( X_{l-1} \) is the input at depth \( l-1 \).
   - \( b_l \) is the bias.
   - \( \sigma \) is the activation function.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Witness the model's training process using meticulously prepared dataset.

5. **Evaluation:**
   - Assess the model's performance on the test data, scrutinizing accuracy and reliability.

6. **Predictions:**
   - Unlock the model's potential by making real-time predictions on new ASL gestures.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Summarize your findings, suggest improvements, and share insights for future exploration.
