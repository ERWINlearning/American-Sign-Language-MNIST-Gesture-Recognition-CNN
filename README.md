## Introduction

This project is focused on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for American Sign Language (ASL) MNIST classification and gesture recognition. The provided Jupyter Notebook (`American_Sign_Language_MNIST_&_Gesture_Recongition_CNN.ipynb`) contains the code and detailed documentation for training the model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python (>=3.6)
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/salarMokhtariL/American-Sign-Language-MNIST-Gesture-Recognition-CNN.git
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    cd American-Sign-Language-MNIST-Gesture-Recognition-CNN
    jupyter notebook American_Sign_Language_MNIST_&_Gesture_Recongition_CNN.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each code cell and understand the workflow.

## Notebook Overview

1. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the project and its goals.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the ASL MNIST dataset, preprocessing images, and preparing the data for training.
3. **Model Architecture**: Defining the CNN architecture for ASL MNIST classification and gesture recognition.
4. **Model Training**: Training the model using the prepared dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.
